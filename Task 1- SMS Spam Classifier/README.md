Task-1 : SMS Classifier

Introduction:
In today's digital age, where instant messaging is ubiquitous, SMS spam has become a common nuisance. This challenge, however, provides an excellent learning opportunity for those entering the field of data science. This project involves building a machine learning model designed for SMS spam detection, serving as an ideal starting point for beginners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). This task offers a practical introduction to the fundamentals of text classification and NLP.

Dataset
The project utilizes the "SMS Spam Collection Dataset," which is available on my GitHub repository. This dataset is a well-curated collection of SMS messages, each labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham.'

Tools and Technologies
The following tools and libraries will be employed in this project:

Python: The programming language used for implementing the model.
pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: A comprehensive machine learning library used for model development and evaluation.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A powerful suite of libraries and programs for working with human language data, particularly useful for text processing and NLP.
Conclusion and Future Work
This project offers beginners a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in machine learning and NLP. As you become more comfortable with the basics, you may explore more advanced techniques such as text normalization (e.g., stemming, lemmatization) and TF-IDF vectorization. The field of data science is vast and full of potential, and projects like this serve as an essential foundation for further exploration and mastery.
